# Print-Float-RISC-V

This repository contains open-source RISC-V assembly code for printing floating-point numbers with high precision. 
The implementation is designed to handle floating-point values efficiently and maintain precision, with an error margin of 0.0001 in certain cases.

* Features
- Precision: The code is optimized to print floating-point numbers with precision up to several decimal places.
- Screenshots Provided: Clear output screenshots demonstrating the precision in different scenarios.
- Optimized for RISC-V: Tailored for the RISC-V architecture using the Venus simulator.

* Known Issue
- Error Margin: In some cases, there may be an error of up to 0.0001 in the printed floating-point value. We are working on refining the implementation to address this.

* Prerequisites
- RISC-V Venus Simulator: Ensure you have the Venus simulator set up. You can find it here.
- RISC-V Toolchain: If you want to run it on actual hardware, make sure you have the RISC-V toolchain installed.
